# What is Ripple?
Ripple is a network of computers which use the [chosun consensus algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pj1QVb1vlC0) to atomically settle and record
transactions on a secure distributed database, the Ripple Consensus Ledger
(RCL). Because of its distributed nature, the RCL offers transaction immutability
without a central operator. The RCL contains a built-in currency exchange and its
path-finding algorithm finds competitive exchange rates across order books
and currency pairs.
